# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is my code for the project: I originally forked and cloned this repository, then built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
